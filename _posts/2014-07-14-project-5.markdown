title: Garment Matching Algorithm
project-date: November 2018 - December 2018
client: Ombre
category: Algorithm
description: This project was undertaken as a side project during my time at the company. I closely collaborated with a talented fashion stylist to develop an algorithm that matches garments to users based on their physical body traits and preferences. The project heavily relied on the utilization of a graph database, specifically Neo4j. Despite the relatively short timeframe, the project was successfully implemented within a month, thanks to my familiarity and proficiency with the company's tech stack. <br><br> Image by <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/full-shot-woman-clothing-formality-scale_71498627.htm#query=matching%20algorithm%20fashion&position=46&from_view=search&track=ais">Freepik</a>
