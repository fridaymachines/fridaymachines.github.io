description: I had the pleasure to work as a freelancer for WiseAI, a company focused on implementing cutting-edge solutions. In this venture, I was tasked with developing a front-end solution to detect the orientation of human faces. The goal of the project was to ensure that the faces captured by the camera were facing directly towards it. One of the main challenges of the project was to implement the entire algorithm on the client-side for optimal performance, rather than the more common server-side approach. To achieve this, I had to convert PyTorch's model codes to Onnx.js. However, I encountered some limitations during the conversion process, which required me to write custom mathematical functions using pure Javascript. To ensure the accuracy and speed of the algorithm, I conducted numerous tests. I am pleased to share that the project was successfully completed within the given timeframe, showcasing the effectiveness of our collaborative efforts. <br><br>Image by <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/facial-recognition-collage-concept_36295544.htm#page=2&query=face%20recognition&position=1&from_view=search&track=ais">Freepik</a>
