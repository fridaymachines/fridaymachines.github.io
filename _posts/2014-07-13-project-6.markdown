title: Deep Hierarchical Classifier
client: Personal Project
category: Deep Learning
description: This <a href="https://github.com/Ugenteraan/Deep_Hierarchical_Classification">project</a> was developed as an open-source endeavor, driven by my personal quest for knowledge and learning. The main motivation behind it was to explore the feasibility of utilizing a single deep learning model for hierarchical structure prediction. When I stumbled upon a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06692.pdf">research paper</a> lacking open-source code, I felt drawn to take on the task of implementing it myself. Using this project as a proof of concept, I sought to convince the CTO of my former company to consider integrating this model into their production workflow.  <br><br> <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/abstract-futuristic-digital-technology-background_15665059.htm#page=2&query=deep%20hierarchy%20futuristic&position=2&from_view=search&track=ais">Image by rawpixel.com</a> on Freepik
